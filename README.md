# MyPong

As I wanted to learn how to use the shell as a graphic engige, I did something with it. 

It's simple: It's the classic Pong but in vertical. There are 2 paddles (1 and 2) and a ball.

Also the score is showed next to the play field and a little description of the controls above it.

You will notice that the ball' speed will increase in time.

### EasterEgg (?)

If you can get to the highest speed that has this ball. A Hit Combo Score will appear under the usual Score Board.

PD: Paddle and Ball really didnt need a class, but meh.
